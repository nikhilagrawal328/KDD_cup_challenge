In the The KDD Cup 2009, a large marketing databases from the French Telecom company Orange had been offered to work on to predict the propensity of customers to  switch provider (churn), buy new products or services (appetency), make the sale more profitable (up-selling) In this dataset, there are all meaningless header names for the features. That's why we need to understand the relations between those features. The most important point for the analysis is to visualise these relations and put a theory that these relations fit in. We shall clean the data first and visualise. Later with the right questions and analysing those questions, we can find the right model for the best performance for predictions.
